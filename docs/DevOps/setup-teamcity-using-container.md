#### Setup Environment

- It is preferred to run TeamCity in a individual Virtual machine as the state will need to be persisted. If you use same machine as for other docker samples than you might have to setup Jenkins again and again
- Create a Virtual Machine and [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

#### Setup TeamCity

- Pull Teamcity Official image

				
					`docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-server`
				

- Create Volumes for Data and logs directory so that if container stops or kills we dont need to setup again

				
					`docker volume create team-city-data docker volume create team-city-logs`
				

- Run the TeamCity container

				
					`docker run -it --name team-city          -v team-city-data:/data/teamcity_server/datadir          -v team-city-logs:/opt/teamcity/logs          -p 8111:8111 jetbrains/teamcity-server`

				

- Get the machine IP address from `ifconfig` and browse the url similar to http://192.168.29.76:8111
- Choose the Internal database as we are not deploying a full fledge server.
- Setup is now complete for TeamCity server

##### Add TeamCity Agent with Docker build capability

- We will add agent which will have capability to build docker images or do docker deployments.
- Create docker volume for persisting Agent configuration so that we don't need to reconfigure it if container is killed.

				
					`docker volume create agent01`
				

- The agent itself will run inside docker. This means TeamCity agent will leverage Docker in Docker (Nested Virtualization) capability to run any docker based build steps.

				
					`docker run -it -e SERVER_URL="192.168.29.105:8111"  	    -e DOCKER_IN_DOCKER=start --privileged  	    -v agent01:/data/teamcity_agent/conf  	    --name agent01 jetbrains/teamcity-agent:2020.2.3-linux-sudo`
				

- Parameters
    - `SERVER_URL`
        - Team city Server url which we ran in previous step
    - `DOCKER_IN_DOCKER`
        - To enable docker related commands indie Team city agent container
    - `--privileged`
        - This falg is required otherwise docker service will not start inside container

- We are running Docker service inside team agent container as Privileged so as to prevent any docker command issues.
- We have used the `linux-sudo` image which is required for running docker based builds, but there are many predefined images available. Please follow link in ReferencesÂ 
- Verify Team Agent is visible in TeamServer UI and Authorize the Agent to use it in TeamCity projects
